# A.I. Bot using Natural Language (via WireApp)
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue.svg" alt="License: GPL v3"/></a>

An alpha implementation using NLU and Deep learning with WireApp chat platform providing the interaction interface. There are two sample use cases:

* answer questions about EQ product for companies
* jobs at Caura & Co.


Language capacity is limited, so default replies are preconfigured when bot does not reach an answer in a sensible time. This time varies based on the perceived complexity of the question.
